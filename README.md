# dotachallenger
A simple Dota profile and recent matches viewer.  Later on we'll have the ability to send friends in-game challenges to complete in timed periods and rank friends who complete the challenges for some competitive fun.

To Do
1. Create a simple dota app to view a player's profile with basic stats like k/d wins , losses and match history. 
2. create a GUI (web or desktop) interface to view the data. 
3. Create challenges for players that will be viewable on the app e.g (get 10 kills in a game )
4. Invite players to the app to complete challenges while playing dota.
5. Create a leaderboard for the challenges
